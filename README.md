# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where some Tailwind CSS classes are not correctly applied, leading to unexpected rendering results.  The issue may stem from incorrect configuration, conflicts with other CSS, or problems with the build process.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind CSS classes, such as `bg-red-500` and `p-4`, are not being applied consistently in the output HTML, even though they are included correctly in the JSX/HTML.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions may vary depending on your setup).
3. Observe the rendered output of the specified component.

The expected outcome is a red box with padding; however, in the bug state, the styling may be missing, partially applied, or entirely incorrect.

## Solution

The solution involves [brief description of solution, e.g.,  verifying the Tailwind configuration, resolving CSS conflicts, or correcting build process errors].  See `bugSolution.js` for implementation details.
